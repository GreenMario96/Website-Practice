<h3>I Hate The Word "Latinx"</h3>
<p id="OK">It's based on the non-binary latin american group, which makes up less than 1% of the world, and is way too specific. It's forcing a word into a language that one person cannot change. The majority of latin-americans despise the word, either because it's pronounced differently because of how Spanish works or it's breaking the rule that makes Spanish a romance language. The majority of people who use the word criticize the language they think they can change because they think a language that was designed in a way they somehow found offensive was offensive to them despite not knowing a thing about that language. WE ALREADY HAVE AN OPTION. THE MASCULINE FORM IS ALSO THE GENDER NEUTRAL FORM. IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, USE LATINE. STOP THINKING YOU'RE SMARTER.</p>
